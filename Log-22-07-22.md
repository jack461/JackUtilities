# What's wrong with JSFX ?

I have been mainly programming in JSFX these last two years, and I have spent a lot of time wondering if I should not switch to another language such as C.
JSFX is quite usable, but it is far from beeing perfect.

I take the following example from Justin Frankel himself super8 looper:

```
function setstate_for_rec(rec, state) (
  // ugly cruft
  rec = (rec-mem_stlist)/st_num;
  rec == 0 ? ch1.setstate(state) :
  rec == 1 ? ch2.setstate(state) :
  rec == 2 ? ch3.setstate(state) :
  rec == 3 ? ch4.setstate(state) :
  rec == 4 ? ch5.setstate(state) :
  rec == 5 ? ch6.setstate(state) :
  rec == 6 ? ch7.setstate(state) :
  rec == 7 ? ch8.setstate(state);
);
```
Don't get me wrong.
I won't say that this code is ugly. In fact, it is the best that you can do. However, it reveals two features lacking in JSFX : arrays of "objects", and a switch/case instruction.

So JSFX has  pros and cons, I will try in this thread to discuss them, and possibly explain some of the tricks I use to get around them.

I intend to discuss things related to "advanced" JSFX programming, like meeory and memory allocation, strings, objects, switch construct, and certainely a few other things. I will start with the aspect of declarations.

## Declarations

My main problem with JSFX have always been the declations, and more specifically, the lack of them.
Although I have been programming for more than 50 years, I'm not a good typist. I make typos, and if I spell wro
ng a variable name, there is almost no help from the system to discover that.
My "new" variable has just a value of zero, and that's it. But any algorithm that uses "this" variable is now incorrect?

So my first request about JSFX would be **Provide an option to make mandatory variable declation, with a keyword such as _variable_, _var_, _dcl_, _define_, _def_,
or even _ISolemnlyDeclareIWantToUseTheFollowingVariables_.**
